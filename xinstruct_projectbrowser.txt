let's flesh out page_production and production.html as follows: the top button interface will look similar to the search page.  there will be no search bar, but there will be drop-down buttons for years, projects, apps which will be sourced from db_table columns job_year, job_name and job_apps.  essentially, the expected behavior is that, when a user picks a year, the projects drop-down get updated with that year's projects, and when a project is selected, the directories drop-down get updated with the job_apps for that job.  when a job_app is picked, i would like to implement an os-aware routine called event_jobactive_navigate_to_app_dir() which will launch an os.system() call that will open up an 'explorer' window that is open to that job_app.  you will use that job's job_path_job and currently selected job_apps app to build that path. so, for instance if job_path_job=$DEPOT_ALL/assetdepot/jobs_dummy/projectdepot/2024/24_cherry_a and job_app='data' then the window would open to $DEPOT_ALL/assetdepot/jobs_dummy/projectdepot/2024/24_cherry_a/data.  Note db table design is as defined in db_jobtools.db_sqlite_table_jobs_create.
